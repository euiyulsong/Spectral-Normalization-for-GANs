### Architecture

### Overview
A discriminator of the standard GANs is inaccurate and unstable during training and its derivative can be unbounded and incomputable. Thus, this spectral normalization impose regularization on the space outside of the support of a generator and data distribution. The formulas of the weight normalization through spectral normalization are as follows:

A spectral normalization uses power iteration method and approximation of the spectral norm to estimate σ(W).

### Data
* ```CIFAR-10```: downloads from the chainer library

### Command
* ```make normalize```: preprocess, train, and evaluate the model

### Result

* My spectral normalized GANs (SNGANs) generate fake images accurately and stably. For instance, the images below are the images generated by the SNGANs after trained for 320 epochs (50,000 iterations). Objects depicted in the image are very intuitive that they are easy to categorize with naked eyes.

* **Inception Scores**

α | β1 | β2 | ndis | inception_score |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
0.0002 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 5 | |
### Limitation
* Due to time-constraint to complete this project, I was not able to run my model against the stl-10 dataset nor compare my model with other regularization techniques.
